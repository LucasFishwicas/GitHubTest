CREATED THIS FILE TO TRACK MY PROGRESS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS CS1104 ON GITHUB.

Unit 1:

I started reading Boolean Logic (Nisan and Schocken);
   Developing that familiar feeling of curious intrigue.

NANDgates++
Developers routinely define abstractions (Interfaces) and implement them,
or get other people to implement them.

Discussion post posted in the morning. Day was spent studying Psychology and that Discussion Post has also been posted.

Unit 2:

Half Adder:
Sum = XOR[A, B]; Carry = AND[A, B];  (A&&B ? Carry : A||B ? Sum); 

Full Adder:
Sum = XOR[XOR[A, B], Carry in]; Carry out = OR[AND[XOR[A, B], Carry in], AND[A, B];

1 bit is a Full Adder circuit - 4 bits are 4 interlinked Full Adder circuits.
