Edit on GitHub for pull testing
Successfully pulled, but was hoping for a way of checking if updates had
been made remotely (checked with git status but it stated that nothing had changed)

Editing file using Vim (first time, learning)
- all commands seem to take affect on all chars/words/lines immediately after the cursor
- used 'yy' to 'yank' line above and 'p' to paste below,
- then deleted 1 char at a time with 'dl' and discovered 'dd' to delete whole line
- 'i' to insert text, 'cw' to change a word
- ESC to finish editing
