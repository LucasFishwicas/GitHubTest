Learning vim

Vim Movements
+++ w -> word, b <- word
+++ f<char> = jump to that char, t<char> = jump before that char

Integrating terminal and learning about buffers
+++ switching between buffers (open files) with ":b"
+++ ":split <file name> will open <file name> in split window (previously I simply
":split" and changed the buffer with ":b <file name>)

Window size can be changed with ":resize <+/-> <int>" 
+++ int value represents lines added (+) or removed (-)

Relative window size can be controlled with ctrl-w
+++ ctrl-w _ (| for vertical) maxes out the current window size
+++ ctrl-w = splits windows evenly
+++ ctrl-w R will swap window positions
