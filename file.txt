had changed)

Learning vim

Vim Movements
+++ w -> word, b <- word
+++ f<char> = jump to that char, t<char> = jump before that char

Integrating terminal and learning about buffers
+++ switching between buffers (open files) with ":b"
+++ ":split <file name> will open <file name> in split window (previously I simply
":split" and changed the buffer with ":b <file name>)

Window size can be changed with ":resize <+/-> <int>" 
+++ int value represents lines added (+) or removed (-)

Relative window size can be controlled with ctrl-w
+++ ctrl-w _ (| for vertical) maxes out the current window size
+++ ctrl-w = splits windows evenly
+++ ctrl-w R will swap window positions

		    Lesson 5.3: SELECTING TEXT TO WRITE


	** To save part of the file, type  v  motion  :w FILENAME **

  1. Move the cursor to this line.

  2. Press  v  and move the cursor to the fifth item below.  Notice that the
     text is highlighted.

  3. Press the  :  character.  At the bottom of the screen  :'<,'> will appear.

  4. Type  w TEST  , where TEST is a filename that does not exist yet.  Verify
     that you see  :'<,'>w TEST  before you press <ENTER>.

  5. Vim will write the selected lines to the file TEST.  Use  :!dir  or  :!ls
     to see it.  Do not remove it yet!  We will use it in the next lesson.

NOTE:  Pressing  v  starts Visual selection.  You can move the cursor around
       to make the selection bigger or smaller.  Then you can use an operator
       to do something with the text.  For example,  d  deletes the text.
